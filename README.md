Cryptocurrency Clustering Challenge

Overview

In this challenge, you'll apply your Python and unsupervised learning skills to analyze and predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. The goal is to use clustering techniques to identify patterns and group similar cryptocurrencies based on their price movements.

Objective

Implement K-Means clustering to categorize cryptocurrencies based on 24-hour and 7-day price changes.

Analyze the impact of reducing the number of features on the clustering results.

Determine whether fewer features still allow for effective clustering.

Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas

Scikit-Learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

K-Means Clustering

Analysis & Findings

Question: After visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, what is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?

Answer: Using fewer features can still provide similar model performance, as four distinct clusters are clearly identified. This suggests that the key patterns in the data remain intact even with a reduced feature set, making the model more efficient without significantly compromising accuracy.

Conclusion

The analysis demonstrates that a reduced feature set can still be effective in clustering cryptocurrencies based on their price changes. This insight can help optimize future clustering models by selecting the most relevant features without unnecessary complexity.
